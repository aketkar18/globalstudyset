# Global Study Set - High School Project

This project was my first Java project during high school, aimed at helping users learn new languages through flashcards. The program allows users to automatically generate flashcards with phrases in two different languages. Users can study the flashcards, take quizzes, manage favorites, and track their progress.

## Features

1. Create custom flashcards or use randomly generated ones based on selected languages.
2. Study the flashcards in a sequential manner, with options to flip, skip, favorite, edit, or remove cards.
3. Take quizzes to test your knowledge of the phrases in the study set.
4. Save favorite flashcards to review later.
5. Track your progress by monitoring the number of times you've accessed a card and your failure rate.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply compile and run the `Main` class. The program will prompt you to create your own study set or use a randomly generated one based on selected languages. You can then choose to study the flashcards or take a quiz on the study set. Additionally, you can view and manage your favorite flashcards.

## Classes

The project consists of three main classes:

1. `Card` - Represents a flashcard with a phrase in two different languages.
2. `StudySet` - Manages a collection of `Card` objects, allowing users to study, take quizzes, and manage favorites.
3. `Main` - Entry point of the program, handles menus, and user inputs to control the program.

## Limitations

As this was my first Java project in high school, there may be some limitations and areas for improvement. The program could be expanded to include additional features such as a graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
